 ##  ðŸ“Š DataWarehouse and Analytics Project 

Welcome to the Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio repository â€” a comprehensive showcase of modern data engineering practices and analytics-driven insights. This project reflects the full cycle of a data warehousing solution, from ingesting raw data to delivering analytical value, structured to mirror real-world use cases and best practices.

ðŸ§± **Data Architecture Strategy**
This solution adopts the Medallion Architecture design pattern, employing a layered approach for scalability and clarity across data processing stages:


Bronze Layer: Raw datasets are ingested directly from source files (CSV) and loaded into a SQL Server database without transformation.

Silver Layer: Intermediate processing takes place here â€” including data cleansing, formatting, and normalization â€” to ensure consistency and readiness for modeling.

Gold Layer: Finalized, business-friendly data is structured into a star schema optimized for querying, reporting, and strategic analysis.

ðŸ§¾ **Project Summary**

Key components of this project include:

Modern Data Architecture: Built using Medallion Architecture across three layers (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold).

ETL Processes: Development of robust extract-transform-load workflows from source to analytics-ready data models.

Dimensional Modeling: Fact and dimension tables designed for efficient analytical querying and business intelligence.

Insight Generation: Use of SQL queries and reporting tools to surface trends and strategic business metrics.




ðŸ›  **Tools and Resources**

The entire project setup is free and open-source, leveraging the following platforms and tools:

Datasets: Download source CSV files for ERP and CRM systems.

SQL Server Express: Lightweight, free edition of SQL Server.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): GUI for interacting with your SQL Server instance.

DrawIO: Create architecture diagrams, data models, and flowcharts.

Notion Project Guide: Access to project steps and detailed instructions.

Notion Template: Use a pre-designed template for planning your workflow.



ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1: Data Engineering**

Objective:
Design and implement a modern data warehouse for consolidated reporting using SQL Server.

Scope:
Source Files: Load ERP and CRM data from CSV files.

Data Quality: Clean and reconcile inconsistencies to prepare for integration.

Unified Model: Merge datasets into a cohesive schema ready for business consumption.

Focus: Only the most recent dataset is considered; historical tracking is outside the scope.

Documentation: Comprehensive metadata and modeling notes included to support stakeholders and analysts.

**Phase 2: Business Intelligence & Reporting**

Objective:
Extract meaningful insights and KPIs from the warehouse using SQL analytics, focusing on:

Customer segmentation and behavior

Product performance trends

Sales growth and seasonality
